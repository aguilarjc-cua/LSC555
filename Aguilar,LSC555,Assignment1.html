		<h1>Smithsonian Digital Library</h1>
		<h2><u>System Introduction</u></h2>
		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>
		Smithsonian libraries specialized branches to assist with the Smithsonianâ€™s research and curation of materials, often unique objects with cultural and historical contexts. They provide the museums with resources and services to understand authentic answers for the community. Smithsonian Libraries integrated their deparate museum systems to a more Web 2.0 model from distinct, separate silos to open access user-centered set up. 




		</p>
		<h3>Users</h3>
		<p>
		<a href="https://library.si.edu/digital-library">Smithsonian's Digital Library</a> serves as a resource for not only their museum system, but for their community including the public, scholars, or anyone seeking information of their wide range of covered topics. Their availability of information spanning across many disciplines can be noted <a href="#Compiled Resources">here</a>. At the forefront the library supports all museum staff, researchers, and curators. While their online database also provides access to staff, it caters moreso to the public. Their general search bar and topic browsing options allow the public to find a wide range of materials across many databases with the option to conduct specific searches. Users input search data through the search bar or browsing topics and receive either specific results or range of results as output depending on the search method. 

	
		</p>
		<h3>Content</h3>
		<p>
		Browsing the different museum and digital library resources are arranged into three main categories: <b>Online Books</b>, <b>Collections</b>, and <b>Exhibitions</b>. Online Books are provided information of Title, Description, Frequesncy of Publication for journals, Local Notes (such as donation source, Links of covered Subjects/Collections, and Location with options to request physical copy of resource. Online Books can be viewed on the webpage or downloaded. Exhibitions available online have their own navigation pages to sift through materials in the Exhibition. Exhibitions that are not completely digitzed instead provide Bibliography PDFs of all the materials included in the exhibit with item numbers and information from its display card.

		<h2><u>Analysis</u></h2>
		<p>
		<h3>Unique Features</h3>
		Smithsonian Library's biggest key feature are the many methods to input for a search. Input allows for either general information seeking through keywords in the various search methods or link redirections through links on other webpage entries by selecting out of available keywords until a specific material is found for viewing. The online Exhibitions primarly follow the latter form of input. The Library Catalog untilizes the former. 	</p>
		<p>
		The Library Catalogs many searches is a unique method of input. It does not require an account to use and allows for searches across all Smithsonian Libraries throughout its system and associated museums. The method allows the main patrons of museum staff and researchers navigate the materials while also providing options for general patrons. The Search methods are via: <b>Keyword</b>, <b>Browse</b>, <b>Combined</b>, and <b>Number</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keyword Search allows keyword search in multiple fields of: General, Author, Title, Subject, and Serials. It also allows searches in other languages, specifically Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Browse Search reviews alphabetical or numberical indexes based on input terms entered into one of the Browse options of Author, Title, Serial Title, Series Title, All Subject, or Uniform Title. Combined Search requires input of keywords with option to refine the search by language, specific library, and access permissions. Language options are expanded to include Spanish, German, French, Polish, and Norwegian. Combined search also include filtering by publication date ranges and sorting options. Number Search allows search through unified codes for materials through the : ISBN/ISSN Exact Match, Library of Congress Call Number, Local Call Number, OCLC Number Exact Match, Barcode, and Bib No. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The search feature allows various ways to access all the Smithsonian Library's databases with one search input and sifts through many databases for a varied search output across many disciplines. The feature promotes browsing and curiosity for patrons as well as specific searching for Smithsonian staff and researchers.

		<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
		<a href="https://siris-libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=17585PP4N5903.73490&menu=search&aspect=Keyword&npp=20&ipp=20&spp=20&profile=liball&ri=&term=&index=GW&x=17&y=14&aspect=Keyword&term=&index=AW&term=&index=TW&term=&index=SW&term=&index=.JW">Keyword Search</a> should have an explanation or quick link access to an explanation of what the different keyword searches mean. A general public patron or new user will not understand what to search for under which keyword.
		</li>
		<li>
		Add a notification of entering a different domain than the <a href="library.si.edu">Library Site</a>. Smithsonian has many resources so while browsing it's easy to enter a different section of Smithsonian resources. While browsing a publiation I ended up in <a href="research.si.edu">Smithsonian Research Online</a>. Although the page is still under Libraries and Archives, it makes navigation difficult because then a search could require multiple tabs or losing their search by being redirected off the library resources.
		</li>
		<li>
		Staff access and Public access of Library resources could be separated but still access the same site. Resources are distinguished for staff by labels next to listed links. Having too much information in one place can be confusing for general patrons and unecessary to display for them. A separate staff page could be associated with their institution login and user information which displays staff specific options and resources.
